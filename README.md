# Classification

This Python code is a basic classification program: 

Firstly, the code creates a set of training points. Then, it randomly generates additional points and assigns them colours, based on what colour the N nearest other points are. The files contain results after running the program that generates 2000, 4000, 10000 and 40000 additional points.
